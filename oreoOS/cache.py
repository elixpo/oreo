"""TTL-cached file storage for app data fetched over WiFi.

Apps that hit the network (Badge, Commits, Weather, future Identity sync)
all do the same dance:

  1. on entry: show whatever's in the cache so the screen isn't blank
  2. if the cache is older than TTL, fire a fresh fetch in the background
  3. when the fetch lands, swap the new data in + persist

This module wraps that into one function pair:

    from oreoOS.cache import save, load

    save("apps/badge/cache.txt", profile_dict)
    profile, age_s = load("apps/badge/cache.txt", ttl_s=3600)

`profile` is None when the file doesn't exist OR has expired past `ttl_s`;
`age_s` tells the caller how stale the cache was (so they can show
"updated 5 min ago" in the UI).

The serializer is intentionally text-based (key=value per line) because
MicroPython's filesystem can survive a partial write but its JSON parser
is mp_lexer-allocated and a corrupt file would crash the boot. A few
lines of `name=Ayushman` survive any abrupt reset.
