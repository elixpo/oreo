"""Tiny HTTP server for AirDrop-style file transfer over WiFi.

The badge advertises itself over BLE (so the phone sees it in Nearby /
the Oreo Pair flow), but the actual file bytes flow over WiFi because
the BLE GATT path is too slow and there's no Classic-BT OBEX on this
firmware. When WiFi is up, this module:

  GET  /          serves a one-page upload form (HTML in-line below)
  POST /upload    parses one multipart file part, writes it to flash,
                  routes by extension:
                       .png .jpg .jpeg .gif  -> apps/gallery/assets/raw/
                       .md                   -> documents/
                       .txt                  -> documents/
                       (anything else)        -> rejected with 415
  GET  /favicon.ico  204 (silences browser noise)

Design notes
------------
* Single-threaded, non-blocking. `tick()` is called from the OS run
  loop; we only ever process one HTTP request per tick. A long upload
  freezes the UI for the duration — acceptable for v1 because the
  phone-side share takes a couple of seconds for typical photos.
* Multipart parsing is streamed: we never hold the full payload in
  RAM. Chunks land directly into the on-disk file as they arrive,
  with a sliding-window check for the closing boundary marker.
* No HTTPS. The transfer happens on the local LAN; adding TLS would
  pull in ~30 KB of code and zero security benefit for a peer who
  could already sniff the broadcast.

Public surface:
    http_server.start(os_obj)   open listening socket on WiFi IP

    http_server.stop()          close listening socket
    http_server.url()           "http://192.168.x.y/" — show on screen
