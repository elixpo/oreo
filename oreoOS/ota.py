"""Over-the-air update client for OreoOS.

Update model
============
A "release" is a versioned manifest file pinned to a GitHub release of
the OreoOS repo. The manifest lists every file in the OS tree along
with its size and SHA-256, plus URLs to download each file.

CI publishes the release. The badge:

  1. Periodically (or on user request) hits the GitHub Releases API:
         GET https://api.github.com/repos/<OTA_REPO>/releases/latest
     and reads the asset called `manifest.json`.

  2. Compares manifest["version"] against oreoOS.config.VERSION.

  3. If newer, downloads every file whose local sha256 differs into the
     staging directory `/_ota/` on the badge's filesystem. Validates
     each file's hash. Writes the manifest itself last as a "ready"
     marker.

  4. Sets the OS settings flag `ota_pending=True`. The home screen
     surfaces an "Update ready, reboot to install" pill.

  5. On the next boot, `apply_pending()` runs BEFORE the launcher.
     If `/_ota/manifest.json` exists, every file under `/_ota/` is
     moved into its final location atomically (write-then-rename), the
     manifest is deleted, the staging directory removed, and the boot
     continues normally.

Why this shape
==============
* No partition swapping — the ESP32-S3 doesn't need OTA partitions for
  this, because we update files on the LittleFS filesystem rather than
  the MicroPython firmware itself. Bricking risk is bounded: if a file
  copy is interrupted, the manifest never lands and the OS keeps
  booting the old version.
* Manifest is JSON for human inspection and CI-side tooling. The
  badge's parser is the stdlib `json` module which MicroPython ships.
* Hash check on EVERY file before applying: a brownout during download
  can't corrupt the live OS because the bad bytes sit in the staging
  area until the manifest seals the deal.

Channels
========
A "channel" is a tag prefix on the GitHub release:
    stable/v1.3.0     -> stable channel
    beta/v1.4.0-rc1   -> beta channel
The OTA module fetches the latest release whose tag begins with the
channel name. Default is "stable" so badges don't auto-pick up rc
builds.
