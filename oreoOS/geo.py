"""Where the badge is, from its public IP address.

Weather uses this when the owner set no WEATHER_LAT / WEATHER_LON: the
badge asks a keyless geolocation service where its internet connection
is, and gets a latitude, a longitude and a town. City-level only, from the
network's address; no GPS, and nothing is sent but the request itself.

lookup() does network I/O (DNS, TLS, one GET): call it off the UI thread,
as Weather does from its fetch worker. The last good answer is kept in
memory and in /state/geo.json, so later calls and the next boot have a
location even when the services are unreachable. location() never
touches the network.

Setting WEATHER_LAT and WEATHER_LON in the profile always wins.
