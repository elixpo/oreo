"""Background network service (#118, #119).

Owns what happens around the Wi-Fi link so that no network work runs
inside a UI frame for longer than a poll:

  * boot auto-connect: begin() applies the boot gates (secrets flag, the
    Settings auto-connect switch, the brownout skip, safe mode) and starts
    wifi.auto_begin(); tick() drives wifi.auto_tick() from the run loop.
  * link-up jobs: when the link comes up (however it came up: boot
    auto-connect, a re-join, or the WiFi app), the LAN upload server is
    (re)bound and a clock sync is scheduled. A drop and re-join that
    happens between two polls is still caught when the join went through
    wifi.connect_poll() (auto-connect or a manual join: link_seq() moves)
    or when the station came back with a different IP. A reconnect done
    by the ESP-IDF driver itself, on the same IP, is not seen; nothing
    needs to re-run for it (the listener is still bound to that IP).
  * time sync: timeutil.sync_from_ntp() (DNS lookup + UDP query, up to a
    few seconds) runs on a one-shot _thread worker, retries with backoff
    and re-syncs every NTP_RESYNC_S.
  * keep-alive: a dropped link is noticed within POLL_MS and re-joined
    with wifi.auto_begin() (last network first, then other saved ones),
    with backoff. Boot auto-connect that found nothing is retried the
    same way, so walking into range later still connects.
  * quiet window: nothing above starts until QUIET_MS after the first
    Home frame is on the panel, so the first presses are answered at once.

Why a worker thread and not asyncio: the run loop is a plain synchronous
loop (launcher.run_app), and the slow part, socket.getaddrinfo(), is a
blocking call with no asyncio variant on MicroPython. Under asyncio it
would still stall the loop. A _thread worker releases the GIL inside the
blocking lwIP calls, so the UI keeps running. The wifi state machine
(auto_begin/auto_tick) and the HTTP listener stay on the UI thread: they
are non-blocking already and are not written to be thread-safe.

Status for the status bar and the C panel: status() / status_text() /
short_text(). The manual "Sync time" rows call request_sync() and watch
sync_result() for the outcome (#118 follow-up).
