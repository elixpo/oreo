"""Is a computer on the badge's USB port?

MicroPython 1.28 on the ESP32-S3 runs its console over the chip's native
USB with TinyUSB (shared/tinyusb), but gives Python no way to ask TinyUSB
about the host: tud_mounted(), tud_ready() and tud_cdc_connected() (DTR)
are only used inside the C stdio code, machine.USBDevice offers config(),
active(), submit_xfer(), stall() and remote_wakeup() (none of them report
the host, and reconfiguring it would drop the console), and sys.stdout
writes and select.poll() look the same with or without a host.

So this module reads the USB controller itself (the Synopsys DWC2 core at
0x60080000, ESP-IDF's USB_DWC) through machine.mem32. Reading these
registers has no side effects:

  DCFG (0x800)  DEVADDR, bits 4..10: the address the host gave the badge
                while enumerating it. TinyUSB clears it on every bus reset.
  DSTS (0x808)  SUSPSTS, bit 0: the bus has been idle for 3 ms (suspend).
                SOFFN, bits 8..21: number of the last start-of-frame
                packet. A host sends one every millisecond.

A computer is connected when the badge has an address, the bus is not
suspended, and the frame number moves within about 2 ms. That is the
same moment TinyUSB counts as "mounted" (enumerated and configured).

What it does not tell, and its limits:
- It cannot see whether a program on the computer has the serial port
  open (DTR); only that the computer enumerated the badge.
- A computer that is asleep, or that suspends the port to save power,
  suspends the bus and reads as unplugged. Data flowing keeps it awake.
- A charger or a power-only cable reads as unplugged (no host at all).
- The badge has no VBUS sense pin, so unplugging is seen as the bus
  going idle (suspend), which the controller flags within 3 ms.
- Only on an ESP32-S3 running the TinyUSB console (the Oreo Badge
  firmware and ESP32_GENERIC_S3). Elsewhere connected() returns None:
  unknown, and callers keep their old behaviour.

Cost: two or three register reads and up to 2 ms of waiting. Probe
caches the answer and reads again at most once a second.
