"""On-badge timing of opening each app. Runs ON the badge:

    oreo run tools/app_open_probe.py

For every installed app (or the ones in ONLY) it does what the launcher
does when you press A, one step at a time, and prints:

  import     ms to import apps.<name>.main the first time this run,
             with the OreoOS modules it pulled in that were not loaded
             yet (those stay loaded afterwards, as on the badge)
  again      ms for a second import with those modules already loaded:
             the app's own cost on every later open
  compile    ms of `again` spent reading and compiling the app's own .py
             source (what shipping precompiled .mpy would save)
  enter      ms in on_enter()
  frame      ms for the first update() + draw()
  flush      ms for the first display.present()
  heap       KB the open keeps (after a collect) and KB it allocated

then the time of a full gc.collect(), which the launcher runs between
two apps. Each app is closed with on_exit() and unloaded again; nothing
is written to flash by this script (an app's own on_enter may still save
its state, as it does on every open). OreoOS starts again when the CLI
finishes. Paste the whole output into the pull request.
