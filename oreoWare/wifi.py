"""WiFi manager for the Oreo Badge.

Saved networks live in `/wifi.json` on flash — a user-editable list
maintained by the WiFi settings app:

    [
      {"ssid": "Home",   "password": "...", "priority": 1, "metered": false},
      {"ssid": "Hotspot","password": "...", "priority": 5, "metered": true}
    ]

Two sources can populate that list:
  • `secrets.WIFI_NETWORKS` (from `.env` via `tools/deploy.py`) — a
    list of {ssid, password, priority, metered} dicts. On every boot
    `connect_from_config()` merges this list into `/wifi.json`,
    refreshing passwords + priorities and adding any new entries
    without touching user-added networks. Edit `.env`, redeploy,
    new networks are live.
  • The on-device Settings → WiFi → Networks page — `add_saved()` /
    `remove_saved()` write the same json directly.

`.env` format is parallel CSV — first SSID matches first password:

    WIFI_SSID=home_net,elixpo_srv,office
    WIFI_PASSWORD=homepass,srvpass,officepass

`connect_from_config()` walks the merged list in ascending-priority
order (lower number = tried first) and stops on the first SSID that
associates.

Usage:
    from oreoWare import wifi
    wifi.connect_from_config()        # auto-pick best saved network
    wifi.is_connected()
    wifi.list_saved()                 # for the settings UI
    wifi.add_saved(ssid, pw, priority=10, metered=False)
    wifi.remove_saved(ssid)
    wifi.is_metered()                 # current link metered?

    `pump_cb` is called between every recv() so the caller can keep
    the OS run loop alive — typically passes a closure that re-reads
    the button matrix and bumps the screen. The socket is set to a
    50-ms recv timeout so each blocked read can't freeze the UI for
    more than that. If pump_cb returns True the test aborts cleanly
    (used by the WiFi app's "cancel by any keypress" UX).

    Default size dropped from 500 KB → 200 KB. The handshake is
    still amortised but the test finishes in ~1–2 s on home WiFi
    and ~5 s on weak links, both well within user attention span.
