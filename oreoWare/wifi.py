"""WiFi manager for the Oreo Badge.

Saved networks live in `/wifi.json` on flash — a user-editable list
maintained by the WiFi settings app:

    [
      {"ssid": "Home",   "password": "...", "priority": 1, "metered": false},
      {"ssid": "Hotspot","password": "...", "priority": 5, "metered": true}
    ]

Two sources can populate that list:
  • `secrets.WIFI_NETWORKS` (from `.env` via `tools/deploy.py`) — a
    list of {ssid, password, priority, metered} dicts. On every boot
    `connect_from_config()` merges this list into `/wifi.json`,
    refreshing passwords + priorities and adding any new entries
    without touching user-added networks. Edit `.env`, redeploy,
    new networks are live.
  • The on-device Settings → WiFi → Networks page — `add_saved()` /
    `remove_saved()` write the same json directly.

`.env` format is parallel CSV — first SSID matches first password:

    WIFI_SSID=home_net,elixpo_srv,office
    WIFI_PASSWORD=homepass,srvpass,officepass

`connect_from_config()` walks the merged list in ascending-priority
order (lower number = tried first) and stops on the first SSID that
associates.

Usage:
    from oreoWare import wifi
    wifi.connect_from_config()        # auto-pick best saved network
    wifi.is_connected()
    wifi.list_saved()                 # for the settings UI
    wifi.add_saved(ssid, pw, priority=10, metered=False)
    wifi.remove_saved(ssid)
    wifi.is_metered()                 # current link metered?

Non-blocking API (OreoOS 2.0). Nothing below ever waits for the radio;
callers poll from their update()/run-loop tick instead:

    wifi.scan_start()                 # background scan (own thread)
    wifi.scan_poll()                  # "busy" | "done" | "error" | "idle"
    wifi.nearby()                     # last scan, strongest first; falls
                                      # back to /wifi_seen.json from an
                                      # earlier scan so UIs paint instantly
    wifi.connect_begin(ssid, pw)      # starts association, returns at once
    wifi.connect_poll()               # CONN_* result string
    wifi.auto_begin() / auto_tick()   # boot auto-connect state machine

Diagnostics (REPL): wifi.debug_dump() prints a ring buffer of scan / join
/ auto-connect transitions with the driver's status codes; wifi.diag()
returns a snapshot of the radio state. Passwords are never logged.

# Non-blocking scan / connect / boot auto-connect (OreoOS 2.0)
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Everything below returns immediately. A scan runs in a short-lived
# `_thread` worker: MicroPython's ESP32 port releases the GIL around
# esp_wifi_scan_start(), so the UI keeps drawing while the radio hops
# channels (~1.5-2.5 s). Builds without `_thread` fall back to a
# synchronous scan, which costs one ~2 s hitch but is otherwise identical.
#
# The worker only touches `_scan_raw` / `_scan_err` / `_scan_busy`; all
# parsing, flash writes and state changes happen on the main thread in
# scan_poll(). Each scan carries a generation number so a worker that was
# abandoned (scan_poll timeout) can never publish into a later scan.
#
# How the MicroPython 1.28 ESP32 driver behaves (ports/esp32/network_wlan.c),
# which everything here is written against:
#
#   • wlan.scan() does NOT raise when IDF refuses to scan (for example
#     ESP_ERR_WIFI_STATE while the STA is connecting or retrying): it
#     returns an empty list. An empty scan is therefore "maybe refused",
#     not "nothing nearby".
#   • wlan.status() returns NO_AP_FOUND (201/210/211/212) and AUTH_FAIL
#     (202, also used for CONNECTION_FAIL 205) as soon as one attempt
#     fails, even while the driver is still retrying, and keeps returning
#     it until the next disconnect event or GOT_IP. A new connect() does
#     not clear it.
#   • Every other failure reason (4-way handshake timeout 15, handshake
#     timeout 204, assoc fail 203, ...) is hidden behind STAT_CONNECTING
#     until the configured reconnects are used up. The default is to retry
#     forever, so with defaults a wrong password usually never shows up.
#   • After our own wlan.disconnect() the reason becomes ASSOC_LEAVE (8),
#     which status() reports as STAT_IDLE (1000), during the next join too.
#   • wlan.config(reconnects=n) means n retries after the first attempt;
#     -1 restores "retry forever".
