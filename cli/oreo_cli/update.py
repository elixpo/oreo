"""`oreo update` without a checkout: drive the badge's own OTA over USB.

The badge already knows how to update itself (oreoOS/ota.py, used by its
Updates page). This module steers it from the computer, so the person sees
versions, sizes and progress in the terminal:

    1. read the version on the badge (and any update already downloaded)
    2. bring up the badge's Wi-Fi from its saved networks
    3. ask GitHub (from the badge) for the newest release on the channel
    4. work out which files change, and how much will be downloaded
    5. confirm, check the free space, download into /_ota on the badge
    6. move the files into place (apply_pending, as the boot does)
    7. hardware-reset the badge, wait for it to come back on USB
    8. read the version again and report it

Ctrl-C is honoured until the files start moving into place (step 6). From
then on it is deferred until the step is done, so an interrupted copy
cannot leave OreoOS half old and half new. Even then, OreoOS's own design
covers a power cut: the staged manifest stays until every file is in place,
and the next boot finishes the job.
