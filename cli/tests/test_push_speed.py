"""Push speed: what goes over the wire, counted on the fake transport.

There is no badge in CI, so this measures what can be measured without one
-- execs (round trips) and bytes of code sent per byte of file -- and turns
them into a time estimate with a simple, stated model of the USB link:

  * every exec costs 2 round trips (raw-paste handshake, then the end of
    the paste and the reply) plus the badge compiling the snippet;
  * raw paste is flow controlled: one ack per WINDOW bytes of code, and
    only one window is in flight, so every WINDOW bytes is a round trip;
  * the badge's flash writes run at FLASH_BPS whatever the scheme.

The constants are assumptions (USB full speed, MicroPython's default
256-byte raw-paste window), not measurements; run this file directly for
the table quoted in docs/CLI.md, and replace them with numbers from the
badge once measured (`oreo -v push` with a stopwatch).
