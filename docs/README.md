# 📚 OreoOS docs

Everything in this folder is here for one of three audiences:

- **People who have a badge** → start with [`USB.md`](USB.md): connect it, open the REPL, copy files
- **People who want to build the badge** → start with [`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md)
- **People who want to copy the design** → start with [`DATASHEET.md`](DATASHEET.md)
- **People who want to read the dev journal** → the per-subsystem `.md` files (lcd, buttons, breadboard BOM, badge layout)

`CLI.md`, `USB.md` and `TRANSFER.md` are also published on the website,
rendered from these files when the site is built:
[oreo.elixpo.com/docs/cli](https://oreo.elixpo.com/docs/cli/),
[/docs/usb](https://oreo.elixpo.com/docs/usb/) and
[/docs/transfer](https://oreo.elixpo.com/docs/transfer/). Edit them here.

If you're writing an app, start with [`APPS.md`](APPS.md). For the OS
itself, see the root [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## 🗺 Big-picture reading order

1. **[`../README.md`](../README.md)** — what the badge is, what it does
2. **[`HARDWARE.md`](HARDWARE.md)** — build it on a breadboard
3. **[`DATASHEET.md`](DATASHEET.md)** — every number you need to copy / extend it
4. **[`APPS.md`](APPS.md)** — write your first app
5. **[`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md)** — the PR checklist, cutting a release

## 🧪 Source of truth

When something disagrees:

- **Pin map** → [`../oreoWare/pins.py`](../oreoWare/pins.py)
- **OS version** → [`../oreoOS/config.py`](../oreoOS/config.py) (`VERSION` constant)
- **Theme colours** → [`../oreoOS/theme.py`](../oreoOS/theme.py)
- **OTA release manifest format** → [`../tools/build_release.py`](../tools/build_release.py)

This folder describes those files; it doesn't override them.
