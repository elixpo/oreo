"""USB serial line reader for the Transfer app.

While OreoOS runs nothing else reads sys.stdin (the REPL is not active),
so the app can poll it. Reading never blocks: select.poll() says at least
one byte is waiting before each one-byte readinto(), and a frame stops
reading after `budget_ms` so buttons and the screen stay responsive.
MicroPython's stdin offers no "how many bytes are waiting", so bytes are
taken one at a time; the USB stack holds the rest back (the computer's
writes simply wait) until the app catches up, so nothing is lost.

open() turns off Ctrl-C (micropython.kbd_intr(-1)) so no byte on the
stream can raise KeyboardInterrupt inside OreoOS; close() turns it back
on. The protocol is ASCII-only anyway.

`stream`/`poller`/`writer` are injectable for the host tests.
